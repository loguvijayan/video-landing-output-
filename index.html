          <h1> The mice and the elephents</h1>
          <p>LONG AGO IN INDIA there was an old deserted village.
             Empty were the old houses, streets and shops. 
             The windows were long broken, the stairs collapsed.
             Making it one very fine place for mice to run around,
             you can be sure! 
             For hundreds of happy years the mice had made this deserted pile of rubble their home.

They built a wide network of tunnels, forming extensive mazes. What good times they had, coming and going, with their many dinner parties and festivals, weddings and feasts.  And so time passed.
One day, a herd of elephants, numbering in the thousands, stamped through the village on their way to a big lake in the west.
